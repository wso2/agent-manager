# WSO2 AI Agent Management Platform

An open control plane designed for enterprises to deploy, manage, and govern AI agents at scale.

## Overview

WSO2 AI Agent Management Platform provides a comprehensive platform for enterprise AI agent management. It enables organizations to deploy AI agents (both internally hosted and externally deployed), monitor their behavior through full-stack observability, and enforce governance policies at scale.

Built on [OpenChoreo](https://github.com/openchoreo/openchoreo) for internal agent deployments, the platform leverages OpenTelemetry for extensible instrumentation across multiple AI frameworks.

## Key Features

- **Deploy at Scale** - Deploy and run AI agents on Kubernetes with production-ready configurations
- **Lifecycle Management** - Manage agent versions, configurations, and deployments from a unified control plane
- **Governance** - Enforce policies, manage access controls, and ensure compliance across all agents
- **Full Observability** - Capture traces, metrics, and logs for complete visibility into agent behavior
- **Auto-Instrumentation** - OpenTelemetry-based instrumentation for AI frameworks with zero code changes
- **External Agent Support** - Monitor and govern externally deployed agents alongside internal ones

## Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **amp-instrumentation** | Python auto-instrumentation package for AI frameworks | 
| **amp-console** | Web-based management console for the platform |
| **amp-api** | Backend API powering the control plane | 
| **amp-trace-observer** | API for querying and analyzing trace data | 
| **amp-python-instrumentation-provider** | Kubernetes init container for automatic Python instrumentation |
