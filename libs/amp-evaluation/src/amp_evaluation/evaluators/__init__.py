Evaluators subpackage.

Import Strategy:
----------------

1. Base classes (always available, no dependencies):
   >>> from amp_evaluation.evaluators import BaseEvaluator, FunctionEvaluator

2. Standard evaluators (no external dependencies):
   >>> from amp_evaluation.evaluators.builtin.standard import LatencyEvaluator, TokenEfficiencyEvaluator

3. DeepEval evaluators (requires deepeval package):
   >>> from amp_evaluation.evaluators.builtin.deepeval import PlanQualityEvaluator

4. Registry-based access (lazy loading, recommended):
   >>> from amp_evaluation import get_evaluator
   >>> evaluator = get_evaluator("deepeval/plan-quality")

The base classes are always imported. Built-in evaluators are in the builtin/
subpackage and are auto-discovered via the registry for lazy loading.
